Created a recipe search application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the MealDB API.
Users can search for any food item through the search bar, and the application retrieves and 
displays the recipe along with a list of ingredients. This project offers an easy and convenient
way to find and view recipes for various dishes.
